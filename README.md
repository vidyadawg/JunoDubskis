In order to have this work you will need to follow a few steps.

1) You need to have Python installed on your computer. This can be skipped if you already have it installed on your PC. The best way to do this is just follow the guide here: https://realpython.com/installing-python/ **MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE BOX TO INSTALL IT TO YOUR PATH**
2) Open your Command Prompt and fire the command 'pip install pynput'.
3) Make sure you download both the python file AND the text file. Keep them in the same folder.
4) In your Command Prompt, navigate to the folder with junoDubskis.py in it. Fire 'python junoDubskis.py' to launch the program
5) All should be good! Troubleshooting is at the end.
